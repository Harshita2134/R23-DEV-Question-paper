# R23-DEV-Question-paper
I just entered the hall just a 5 mins ago because i had to attend another meeting 
The moment i entered the hall, i was handed the question paper.
In the question paper I am attempting the second program for develepers domain
I have no idea about erlang but the algorithm of the code is:

input any number 
run a for loop from 1 to n
import the function pi and store it in a variable
use any variable to store only decimal points of the pi using the double fuction
